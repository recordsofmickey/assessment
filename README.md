# assessment
This project is an implementation of the ABN AMRO assessment for Front End Developers. 

You will use an open TV shows API http://www.tvmaze.com/api to create an application that allows users to view a few lists (preferably horizontal list) of TV shows based on different genres (drama, comedy, sports, etc.). 

Your goal is to display a few popular TV shows based on their rating and genre on a dashboard and when the user clicks on a TV show then the details of that TV show should be displayed on another screen. Also, the user should be able to search for a TV show to get the details. You can design your own UI which fits this requirement. 

Required for this project was:

• Please include unit tests 
• Please check that application is running and there are no console errors before sending it to us 
• Please make sure that the UI is simple yet eye-catching
• Please feel free to include more features other than the few mentioned above. 
Please keep in mind that we use VueJS in ABN AMRO. Preferably, you complete this assessment using this framework. However, you may also pick a framework of your choice
• Application must be responsive and mobile friendly 
• Please keep the leverage/use of scaffolding tools, boilerplate templates, plugins etc. to a minimum. We don’t expect you to create things from scratch but, we also would like to see your own creation 
• Please create a readme file that explains your architectural decisions (E.G. why did you choose a specific framework) and make sure you include instructions on how to run your solution, add details about NodeJS version being used and NPM.



I built this running on Node 14.16.1 using Vue3, Vuex and the Vue router. This because, as stated in the assignment ABN AMRO uses this framework.
